    <p class = "About_content"> A disastrous hurricane has struck our town in the upper and middle part of Houston. Thanks to many great volunteers and organizations, we are recovering from the damages of the hurricane, but we have more works to do.
<br /><br />The damage to Houston does not end with the hurricane or the flood. For years on, we Houstonians will need to fight microorganisms, adverse species, harmful chemicals and elements, diminished infrastructure, and more. We will use any and every help to eliminate these threats and restore Houston to better than it was before.
<br /><br />The damage from the Hurricane Harvey is not confined to Houston. Whenever possible, we hope to reach out to neighbor cities and do the same work we do for Houston.
<br /><br />We will document and update on all our activities and steps taken to improve Houstoninan and surrounding communities.
<br /><br />We will start our work from the Northside and the Downtown Houston, where our agents are located, and we hope to continue our work in other parts of the city and the state.
<br /><br />Specifically, the current top priorities for us now is to disinfect microorganisms and insects such as mosquitoes in the standing pools that might pose health hazard to the people.
<br /><br />We will update the page with all the purchases we make and activities we engage in with respect to recovery from Harvey.

     	  	  <h3 id = "sub_head"> Remobilizing automobiles damaged from the flood </h3>


 <p class = "About_content"> Q: Is it OK to start my car after the water recedes?  	<br />
  	<br />
A: Do not attempt to start your car if you suspect that water has entered the tailpipe or got into the car.
  	<br />
  	<br />Having water in the tailpipe could cause engine damage if the pipe is not clear for smoke to come out. You'll have to make sure that your tailpipe is clear of water before attempting to start the car.
  	<br />
  	<br />
Another reason (and more costly sometimes) to not start the car is if water has gotten into the electronics, starting the car will short circuit them causing very costly damage. Most electronic components should be properly dried out before starting the car.
  	<br />
  	<br />
If you're 100% absolutely sure that no water has gone into the tailpipe and that no electronic components have been compromised, then you can give it a try, but do not go beyond a couple of attempts to start it. If it doesn't start from the first or second try, then water might have gotten into your spark plugs.
  	<br />
  	<br />  	<br />
  	<br />
Q: Hi there, my car was not submerged in water but will not start. It has received a lot of water from above during these last few days though. Is there anything I can do to unlock the brakes so it could be towed out?
  	<br />
  	<br />
 It looks like your ABS module has water in it and had caused a short thats sending a faulty signal and causing your brakes to lock up.     	
  	<br />
  	<br />
A: You can handle this in 2 different ways. Lets try the first and easiest way first.
Start the car and put your foot on the break and release and engage the emergency brake, its located in the middle console and has parking brake symbol. Do this a multiple times and see if that releases the brakes.
option 2. Depending on the year of your car the battery could be located under the front driver seat or in the trunk. Turn off your car and disconnect the battery terminals and wait for about 3-5 minutes. This process will reset all your computer monitors and it might work for a few minutes. It wont be safe to drive if that works since the fault will come back.

     	  	<br />
  	<br />
     	Q: Hello. My car was completely covered in water. Does that mean its totaled ?
     	  	<br />
  	<br />  
  A: Typically a car is totaled at this point. However, to answer your question on whether it's worth fixing it all depends on the vehicle's previous condition . At this point there is a chance to get the car running again if you take out all the carpet, electronic modules, computers and dry them out (you can put the computers in rice, helps take out the moisture). You have to make sure you don't start the car and make sure the battery gets disconnected asap. After all components are completely dried out. Get all your fluids replaced and then you can start the car and see what happens.
